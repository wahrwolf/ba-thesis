# Introduction
Companies which want to expand to new regions face one issue. To reach their customers, they have to speak their language.
\TODO{enter some stuff about why humans can not walk on that...}
Because of this, machine translation providers need to adapt quickly on new domain and languages.
Old systems required big text corpora and lots of training to adapt to a new domain.
The goal for this bachelor's thesis is to validate a novel approach called side constraints.

I will compare different architectures and build 2 new text corpora from existing open data.
This will help neural machine translations to train and test new methods in domain control.
