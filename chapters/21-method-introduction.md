# Method
In the following section I introduce the and present the corpus and model selection.
The goal is to train NMTs on different langauges and compare how they benefit from side constraint.

The domain control meachnism here is a direct reproduction of the papter from \TODO{Reference Paper with domain prefixes}.
Therefore I used the setup desriped in the paper.
For the details that where different or not descriped I looked for simliar environments in related work.
