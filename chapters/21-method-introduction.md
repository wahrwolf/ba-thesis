# Method
In the following section I introduce and present the methods used to evaluate the performance impact of the domain control michanism prefix constraints in neural machine translation across different language pairs.
I will first introduce the used data sets and describe my trainings setup for the neural machine translation.

The domain control mechanism here was introduced by \reference{kobus}.
I used a similar setup but because my thesis had a different foucs I changed some aspect.
