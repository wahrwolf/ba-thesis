## Tools and Hardware
### Hardware
The models where trained on Nvidias GTX 980, GTX 1080 and GTX 1080 Ti.
The training produced over 1TiB on models (including checkpoints).

### Software
#### OpenNMT
I used the OpenNMT framework for the training and the and the implementation of the models
It is based on Tensorflow \TODO{reference} and has already been used in academic research.
