## Research Questions
### How does side constraint perform in related and distanted languges?

### Justification
Domain control and adpation is a rather young part of neural machine learning. Current mechnansim discuss mostly how a single mechnasim can improve the translation quality of a given corpus.
Because machine translation systems are currently used mostly as assistence systems (\TODO{find proorf/reference}) they are not expected to translate fachjargon.
The translation or identification from unkonwn languages is currently more relevant.
