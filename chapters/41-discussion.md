# Discussion
## sumamry
- experiments show, that side the use of side constraints works better in close lanaguge
(oder anderherum, wenn falsch)

## comparison to state of art
- general performance (very vague)
	- according to google interpretation of BLEU
- performance on mixed domain texts
	- only clean
- does side constraint work?
	- how much improvement or why not?
- how big is the difference on distant languages?

## future perspective
### my work
- more domains
- more different labels/multi labels
- different model/attention 
- assemment methodic (I KNOW that overfitting is unlikely (as show in results), I CAN NOT PROOVE that gloabl maxximum was found (bc))
- disclaimer of local minima

### our work
#### corpora
- baseline of corpora
- preparation of corpora
- slicing of corpora

#### opennmt
- hyper parameter optimierung
- integration of preparation tools
- corpus store
