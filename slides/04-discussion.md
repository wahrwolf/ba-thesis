# Discussion
## How are domains encoded?
- Context
- Sentence Structure
- Vocabulary

## How does Prefix Constraints work?
- Identify a domain by a token
- Learn overlap, allow generalization
- Understand the concept "Context"

## Findings
- domain distinction differs between languages
- domain distinction differences can not be predicted (yet)
- domain control eases domain distinction on the cost of domain specialization

## Conclusions
- domain control not solved yet
- differences between languages complex
- Prefix Constraints works best on related languages
